                            <p class="article-pa">Living in the unstoppable developing and fast-growing modern era, it is common to assume that being wealthy is defined as a complete happiness by many individuals and is an absolute “finish line” that every child is taught to achieve. From our perspective, this percept is relatively wrong in many situations and different views. Apparently, besides the definition given by the psychology and biology field, it is hard to properly define what true happiness is, due to the variety of percepts and circumstances acquired by loads of human beings. In terms of philosophy, many ancient Greek philosophers had their own solution to this fascinating argument thousand years ago. </p>

                            <p class="quote">"Happiness, whether consisting in pleasure or virtue, or both, is more often found with those who are highly cultivated in their mind and in their character and have only a moderate share of external goods than among those who possess external goods to a useless extent but are deficient in higher qualities."

                        <p class="article-pa">What we mean here is that happiness should not be identified as wealthiness. Now, we focus on a larger scope which involves countries and their economy. The term GDP or Gross Domestic Products was invented in 1944. Since then, GDP is extensively used for evaluation and comparison among nations to conclude how “good” is a country. Apparently, with time-dedicated research into GDP, it is just a measurement of a specific aspect of one country. However, media and society in general have shaped our minds into a way of thinking GDP is a reliable tool to judge our nations. Eventually, GDP obsession leads us into an obstructive development.</p>
                        <p class="quote">
                            "Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials."

                        The main objective of this project is to elaborate and demonstrate the connection between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its Gross National Happiness (GNH). To achieve that, the project must provide answers to the following questions:
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-pa objective-ques"> 1.	Is there a correlation between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its Gross National Happiness (GNH)?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>●	To what extent are these two variables related?</li>
                        <li>●	Are nations with higher GDPs consistently happier, or are there exceptions?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="article-pa objective-ques">2.	What are the key factors that influence the relationship between GDP and GNH?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>●	Are there specific socioeconomic, cultural, or environmental factors that explain variations in the relationship?</li>
                        <li>●	How do policies, social programs, and governance impact this relationship?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="article-pa objective-ques">3.	Can GDP be considered a reliable predictor of GNH, and vice versa?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>●	To what degree can GDP serve as an indicator of a nation's overall happiness and well-being?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="article-pa objective-ques">4.	Can GNH be used as a predictive measure for economic success and growth?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>●	What insights can be gained from data science techniques and visualization tools regarding the GDP-GNH relationship?</li>
                        <li>●	How can data science methodologies enhance our understanding of this complex relationship?</li>
                        <li>●	How can data visualization help communicate these insights effectively to various stakeholders?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="article-pa">Our primary focus will be on developing website functionality to present the data to the audience, showing that there is a link between GDP and GNH combined with detailed answers. from each perspective to avoid subjective or personal consideration.</p>
